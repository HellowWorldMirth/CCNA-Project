# Advance Static Routing

## Objective
1. Connect all branches.
2. All network will communicate with each other.

### Skills Learned



### Tools Used
- I use VMware Workstation to run EVE-NG as an emulator for constructing and testing a Cisco lab environment.
- Putty for SSH.

## Steps
Step 1
- Design the topology

As we can see, we have 3 branches in different location 1. Delhi, 2. Mumbai and 3. Channi. I draw a simple topology with two endpoint, those are connected with a unmanaged Switch and the Switch is connected with a Router. <img width="1215" height="656" alt="topology static routing 3 router" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/861a2840-19d8-4c89-826a-7ec0a497d258" />
